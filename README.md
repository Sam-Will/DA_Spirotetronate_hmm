# HMM Profile for Diels-Alderase Cyclase Enzymes

This repository contains the scripts, data, and documentation necessary for building and validating the HMM profile for Diels-Alderase cyclase enzymes.

## Project Overview

### Motivation
Diels-Alderase cyclases catalyze [4+2] cycloaddition reactions in natural product biosynthesis. This model will add diels alderase annotation in antiSMASH.

### Data Source
The data for this project is curated from:
> **Interrogation of an Enzyme Library Reveals the Catalytic Plasticity of Naturally Evolved [4+2] Cyclases**  
> *ChemBioChem, 2023*
